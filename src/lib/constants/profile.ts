  about: `
I am a Senior Software Engineer specializing in **Backend Systems, Blockchain, and Web3** with over 8 years of experience in architecting secure, scalable, and high-performance environments. My expertise bridges traditional backend development (Node.js, Java, Rust) with deep decentralized technical knowledge, including consensus mechanisms, cryptographic primitives, and smart contract security.

**Technical Focus:**
- **EVM Ecosystem:** Proficient in Solidity, Hardhat, Foundry, and OpenZeppelin standards.
- **Cardano Ecosystem:** Expertise in Plutus (Haskell), Aiken, Lucid-Evolution, and MeshJS.

**What I Deliver:**
- End-to-end design and implementation of **smart contracts** and robust **REST APIs**.
- Seamless **backend integrations** for decentralized applications.
- High-assurance, **secure wallet solutions** and financial primitives.

I am driven by the transformative potential of **DeFi and decentralized systems**. I excel at transforming complex requirements into production-ready systems, optimizing for performance at scale, and ensuring the absolute security and reliability of Web3 applications.
