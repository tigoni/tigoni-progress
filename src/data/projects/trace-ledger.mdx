# TraceLedger | A Blockchain-Based Traceability Solution

## Project Manifesto

### Introduction
TraceLedger is a blockchain-based traceability and payment platform designed to address systemic inefficiencies in the small-scale farmer ecosystem, particularly in the delivery of cash crops destined for export markets. The platform provides an end-to-end digital trail from farm to port, ensuring transparency, accountability, and trust across the entire agricultural supply chain.

The solution leverages Cardano blockchain technology to create an immutable record of each batch of crops from the point of harvest through aggregation, quality checks, logistics, and export. Farmers or cooperatives register crop deliveries via a mobile or USSD interface, with verification checkpoints logged on-chain by certified agents. Once the crop origin and quality are verified, automated smart contracts trigger payments directly to the farmer's wallet or mobile money account.
