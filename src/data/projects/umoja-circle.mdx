# Umoja Circle | A DAO for Defi Investments 

## Project Manifesto

### Introduction

Umoja Circle is a blockchian based, member owned investment platform where members join with crypto, can propose, seek funding and vote on investment/trading strategies from pooled resources. Members also propose investment ideas, vote on them and smart contracts execute these and payments are paid via smart contracts. A govenance token is used for all member activity.

## 🌟 Key Features
- **Stablecoin Onboarding** - Members join the platform by depositing stablecoins like USDT or USDC into smart contracts.
- **Member-Owned** - Users own governance tokens that represent their stake and voting power in the DAO.
- **Governance Token** - A native token enables voting, rewards participation, and represents ownership in the platform.
- **Investment Proposals** - Members submit, discuss, and vote on community-led investment ideas.
- **Smart Contract Execution** - Approved proposals are automatically executed and managed by secure smart contracts.
- **Profit Sharing** - Returns from investments and interest are distributed fairly to members based on token holdings.
- **Transparent Treasury** - All transactions and fund flows are publicly viewable on-chain.
- **Voting & Governance** - Members use tokens to vote on rules, interest rates, and key protocol decisions.
