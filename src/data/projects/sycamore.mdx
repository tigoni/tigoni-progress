# Sycamore | An Identity and Access Management API for Encrypted Health Data on Cardano

## Project Manifesto

### Introduction >
Sycamore API is a secure REST API that enables data to be sesurely accessed and controlled with the use of cryptographic signatures in Cardano blockchain wallets. It provides features that verifies wallet signatures to authorize encrypted data retrieval and sharing across trusted applications. By combining Web3 identity, end-to-end encryption, and compliant data storage, Sycamore empowers individuals with full ownership and privacy over their information. In particular, this implementation of the REST API is designed for access or sharing of encrypted health data by verifying their identity through a signed message from their Cardano blockchain wallet.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features
- **Wallet-Based Access Control** - Secure medical record access using cryptographic signatures from blockchain wallets like Nami or Eternal.
- **Encrypted Data Storage** - Store health data in decentralized or cloud storage with end-to-end encryption, ensuring only authorized users can decrypt and view records.
- **Audit Logging & Consent Management** - Maintain transparent logs of who accessed what data and when, with user-controlled consent for sharing with healthcare providers.
