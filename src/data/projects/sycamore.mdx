# Sycamore | A Rest API for onchain records on the Cardano blockchain

## Project Manifesto

### Introduction
Sycamore is a secure and decentralized platform that enables patients to control access to their medical records using cryptographic signatures from their blockchain wallets. It provides a REST API that verifies wallet signatures to authorize encrypted health data retrieval and sharing across trusted healthcare applications. By combining Web3 identity, end-to-end encryption, and compliant data storage, Sycamore empowers individuals with full ownership and privacy over their medical information.
