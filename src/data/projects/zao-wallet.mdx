# Zao | Mobile Crypto Wallet For Everyday Utility

## Project Manifesto

### Introduction
Zao exists to bridge the gap between opportunity and accessibility in Africa through inclusive, crypto-powered financial tools. We believe in a future where every individual can access and grow wealth, regardless of geography or infrastructure. 

By leveraging stablecoins and blockchain technology, Zao enables frictionless cross-border payments, savings, and investment for underserved communities. We are committed to transparency, user empowerment, and ethical innovation. 
Zao is more than a platform ‚Äî it is a movement to reimagine financial inclusion from the ground up, built by Africans, for Africans, with global potential. Together, we‚Äôre unlocking the value of digital finance for all.
